# EcoPackAI Ranking Configuration
# Based on Weighted Composite Score Calculation
# Priority: Sustainability > CO₂ Impact > Cost

constraints:
  max_cost: 200        # Maximum acceptable cost threshold
  min_recyclability: 50 # Minimum recyclability percentage
  max_co2: 20          # Maximum CO₂ emissions (kg)
  
top_n: 4  # Return top 4 recommendations

# Weighted Composite Score Formula:
# Final Score = w1(Sustainability) + w2(CO₂ Impact) + w3(Cost)
weights:
  sustainability: 0.50  # 50% - Highest priority (biodegradability + recyclability + renewability)
  co2_impact: 0.30      # 30% - Second priority (lower emissions = higher score)
  cost: 0.20            # 20% - Third priority (cost optimization without compromising sustainability)

# Sustainability sub-components:
sustainability_breakdown:
  recyclability: 0.40   # 40% of sustainability score
  biodegradability: 0.40 # 40% of sustainability score
  renewability: 0.20    # 20% of sustainability score (raw material source)
